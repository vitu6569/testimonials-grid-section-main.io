            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
            for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
            The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
            the course, I‚Äôve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

            ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve<br> never written a line of code. I needed <br>some structure from 
            professionals<br> who can help me learn programming<br> step by step. I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former 
            student of theirs<br> who can only say wonderful things<br> about the program. The entire<br> curriculum and staff 
            did not<br> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long for<br> assistance. The agile team 
            project, in<br> particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way<br> that no tutorial 
            could ever have. In<br> fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my<br> developent 
            experience. It certainly<br> helped me land a job as a full-stack<br> developer after receiving multiple<br> offers. 
            100% recommend! ‚Äù
